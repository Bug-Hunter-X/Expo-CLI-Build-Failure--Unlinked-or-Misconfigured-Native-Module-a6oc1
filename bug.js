This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and attempting to run an app that uses a native module which is not properly linked or configured. It typically manifests as a cryptic error message during the build process, lacking specifics about the underlying cause.  The app might not start, or you might encounter an error message related to missing native modules or dependencies. For example, an error might mention a failure to resolve a native module dependency.  Debugging is difficult because the error message is often generic and not directly pointing to the problematic native module.
