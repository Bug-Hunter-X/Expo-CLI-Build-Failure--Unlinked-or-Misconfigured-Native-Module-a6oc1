The solution involves carefully reviewing and correcting the native module integration. Here's how to address it:

1. **Verify Native Module Installation:** Ensure the native module is correctly installed using `expo install <module-name>`. 
2. **Check Linking:** For native modules requiring linking, use Expo's built-in tools to check if the linking is successful and up-to-date. You might need to run commands such as `expo prebuild` or use Expo's documentation for specific guidance on the native module's linking requirements.
3. **Examine Package.json:** Verify that all dependencies in `package.json` are compatible and correctly specified.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Try cleaning your project's build cache by deleting the `node_modules` folder and `ios` and `android` folders, then reinstall dependencies and rebuild. 
5. **Review Build Logs:** Carefully examine the detailed build logs. The logs might contain additional error messages that shed light on the issue. Look for hints related to missing dependencies, linking errors, or compilation problems. 
6. **Platform Specific Issues:** Note that issues might be specific to iOS or Android.  If one platform builds successfully, then the problem likely lies in the setup for the other platform.
