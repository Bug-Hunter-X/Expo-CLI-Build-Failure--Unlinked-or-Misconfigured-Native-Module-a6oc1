# Expo CLI Build Failure: Unlinked or Misconfigured Native Module

This repository demonstrates a common yet challenging issue encountered when using the Expo CLI: build failures due to improperly linked or configured native modules.  The error is often cryptic, providing little direct guidance on the problematic module.

**Problem:**
When integrating native modules in an Expo project, errors during the build process can be difficult to track down.  The error messages are often generic and don't pinpoint the exact module causing the issue.

**Solution:**
Thorough verification of native module installation and linking is crucial.  This might involve double-checking package versions, confirming correct linking through Expo's tools, and verifying that necessary native dependencies are properly set up for the target platform (iOS, Android).  The use of appropriate debugging techniques, like logging and potentially reviewing the build logs closely, can help identify the source of the problem.

* `bugSolution.js`: Demonstrates the corrected setup where native module linking and dependencies are properly addressed.
